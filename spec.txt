## About this app

This is a simple iOS app that allows a user to add a widget to their homescreen to log each of their eating times in a day.

The widget is a 4x1 horizontal widget (medium size)

The widget features six checkboxes for:
- Breakfast
- Snack 1
- Lunch
- Snack 2
- Dinner
- Snack 3

The left side of the widget should show a time since field with the time since the last radio option was clicked.

The background of the widget should slowly fill up as time progresses up til 3 hours. When the time since last eat hits 3 hours the message should change to go eat.

When a new day starts the widget should reset - timer resets to 0 and all items are unchecked.

The app itself doesn't need to do anything for now except prompt the user to add the widget to their homepage.

Please check the code you've written is working at each step by trying to build the app.
